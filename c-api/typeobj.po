":c:func:`PyType_\\*` functions, but do not offer much that's interesting to "
"most Python applications. These objects are fundamental to how objects "

"Type objects are fairly large compared to most of the standard types. The "
"reason for the size is that each type object stores a large number of "

"detail in this section.  The fields will be described in the order in which "

"do objeto de tipo são examinados em detalhes nesta seção. Os campos serão "
