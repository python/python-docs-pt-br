"Return a new :c:type:`PyIntObject` or :c:type:`PyLongObject` based on the "
"string value in *str*, which is interpreted according to the radix in "
"*base*.  If *pend* is non-*NULL*, ``*pend`` will point to the first "
"character in *str* which follows the representation of the number.  If "
"*base* is ``0``, the radix will be determined based on the leading "
"characters of *str*: if *str* starts with ``'0x'`` or ``'0X'``, radix 16 "
"will be used; if *str* starts with ``'0'``, radix 8 will be used; otherwise "
"radix 10 will be used.  If *base* is not ``0``, it must be between ``2`` and "
"``36``, inclusive.  Leading spaces are ignored.  If there are no digits, :"
"exc:`ValueError` will be raised.  If the string represents a number too "
"large to be contained within the machine's :c:type:`long int` type and "
"overflow warnings are being suppressed, a :c:type:`PyLongObject` will be "
"returned.  If overflow warnings are not being suppressed, *NULL* will be "
