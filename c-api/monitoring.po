"The functions below make it possible for an extension to fire monitoring "
"events as it emulates the execution of Python code. Each of these functions "
"accepts a ``PyMonitoringState`` struct which contains concise information "
"about the activation state of events, as well as the event arguments, which "
"include a ``PyObject*`` representing the code object, the instruction offset "
"and sometimes additional, event-specific arguments (see :mod:`sys."
"monitoring` for details about the signatures of the different event "
"callbacks). The ``codelike`` argument should be an instance of :class:`types."
