"In more technical terms, the event loop contains a collection of jobs to be "

"do seu backlog de tarefas e a invoca (ou \"dá a ela o controle\"), "
"semelhante a chamar uma função, e então essa tarefa é executada. Uma vez "
"pausada ou concluída, ela retorna o controle para o laço de eventos. O laço "
"de eventos então seleciona outra tarefa do seu pool e a invoca. Você pode "
"*aproximadamente* pensar na coleção de tarefas como uma fila: as tarefas são "
"adicionadas e processadas uma de cada vez, geralmente (mas nem sempre) em "
"ordem. Esse processo se repete indefinidamente, com o laço de eventos em "
