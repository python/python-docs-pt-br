"Python applications will often use packages and modules that don't come as "
"part of the standard library.  Applications will sometimes need a specific "
"version of a library, because the application may require that a particular "
"bug has been fixed or the application may be written using an obsolete "
"version of the library's interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/venv.rst:17
msgid ""
"This means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the "
"requirements of every application.  If application A needs version 1.0 of a "
"particular module but application B needs version 2.0, then the requirements "
"are in conflict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0 will leave one "
"application unable to run."

"The solution for this problem is to create a :term:`virtual environment`, a "
"self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a "
"particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial/venv.rst:27
msgid ""
"Different applications can then use different virtual environments. To "
"resolve the earlier example of conflicting requirements, application A can "
"have its own virtual environment with version 1.0 installed while "
"application B has another virtual environment with version 2.0. If "
"application B requires a library be upgraded to version 3.0, this will not "
"affect application A's environment."
