"additional functionality. :kbd:`F1` enters the interactive help browser :mod:"
"`pydoc`. :kbd:`F2` allows for browsing command-line history with neither "
"output nor the :term:`>>>` and :term:`...` prompts. :kbd:`F3` enters \"paste "

"When an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack "
"trace. In interactive mode, it then returns to the primary prompt; when "
"input came from a file, it exits with a nonzero exit status after printing "
"the stack trace. (Exceptions handled by an :keyword:`except` clause in a :"
"keyword:`try` statement are not errors in this context.)  Some errors are "
"unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit status; this "
"applies to internal inconsistencies and some cases of running out of "
"memory.  All error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal "
"output from executed commands is written to standard output."

"When you use Python interactively, it is frequently handy to have some "

"are executed, so that objects that it defines or imports can be used without "

":index:`sitecustomize` works in the same way, but is typically created by an "
