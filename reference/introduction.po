"While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English "
"rather than formal specifications for everything except syntax and lexical "
"analysis. This should make the document more understandable to the average "
"reader, but will leave room for ambiguities. Consequently, if you were "
"coming from Mars and tried to re-implement Python from this document alone, "
"you might have to guess things and in fact you would probably end up "
"implementing quite a different language. On the other hand, if you are using "
"Python and wonder what the precise rules about a particular area of the "
"language are, you should definitely be able to find them here. If you would "
"like to see a more formal definition of the language, maybe you could "
"volunteer your time --- or invent a cloning machine :-)."

"It is dangerous to add too many implementation details to a language "
"reference document --- the implementation may change, and other "
"implementations of the same language may work differently.  On the other "
"hand, CPython is the one Python implementation in widespread use (although "
"alternate implementations continue to gain support), and its particular "
"quirks are sometimes worth being mentioned, especially where the "
"implementation imposes additional limitations. Therefore, you'll find short "
"\"implementation notes\" sprinkled throughout the text."

"An implementation of Python written completely in Python. It supports "
