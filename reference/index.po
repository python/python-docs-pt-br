"This reference manual describes the syntax and \"core semantics\" of the "
"language. It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete. The semantics "
"of non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in functions and "
"modules are described in :ref:`library-index`. For an informal introduction "
"to the language, see :ref:`tutorial-index`. For C or C++ programmers, two "
"additional manuals exist: :ref:`extending-index` describes the high-level "
"picture of how to write a Python extension module, and the :ref:`c-api-"
"index` describes the interfaces available to C/C++ programmers in detail."
