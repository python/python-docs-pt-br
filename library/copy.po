msgid ":mod:`copy` --- Shallow and deep copy operations"

msgid ""
"Assignment statements in Python do not copy objects, they create bindings "
"between a target and an object. For collections that are mutable or contain "
"mutable items, a copy is sometimes needed so one can change one copy without "
"changing the other. This module provides generic shallow and deep copy "
"operations (explained below)."

"This module does not copy types like module, method, stack trace, stack "
"frame, file, socket, window, array, or any similar types.  It does \"copy\" "
"functions and classes (shallow and deeply), by returning the original object "
"unchanged; this is compatible with the way these are treated by the :mod:"
"`pickle` module."

"Este módulo não copia tipos como módulo, método, rastreamento de pilha, "
"quadro de pilha, arquivo, soquete, janela, matriz ou outros tipos "
"semelhantes. Ele \"copia\" funções e classes (rasas e profundas), devolvendo "
"o objeto original inalterado; isso é compatível com a maneira que estes "
"itens são tratados pelo módulo :mod:`pickle`."

"In order for a class to define its own copy implementation, it can define "
"special methods :meth:`__copy__` and :meth:`__deepcopy__`.  The former is "
"called to implement the shallow copy operation; no additional arguments are "
"passed. The latter is called to implement the deep copy operation; it is "
"passed one argument, the memo dictionary.  If the :meth:`__deepcopy__` "
"implementation needs to make a deep copy of a component, it should call the :"
"func:`deepcopy` function with the component as first argument and the memo "
"dictionary as second argument."
