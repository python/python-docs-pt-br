"Assignment statements in Python do not copy objects, they create bindings "
"between a target and an object. For collections that are mutable or contain "
"mutable items, a copy is sometimes needed so one can change one copy without "
"changing the other. This module provides generic shallow and deep copy "
"operations (explained below)."

"This module does not copy types like module, method, stack trace, stack "
