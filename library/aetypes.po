"descriptors and Apple Event object specifiers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/aetypes.rst:15
msgid ""
"Apple Event data is contained in descriptors, and these descriptors are "
"typed. For many descriptors the Python representation is simply the "
"corresponding Python type: ``typeText`` in OSA is a Python string, "
"``typeFloat`` is a float, etc. For OSA types that have no direct Python "
"counterpart this module declares classes. Packing and unpacking instances of"
" these classes is handled automatically by :mod:`aepack`."

"An object specifier is essentially an address of an object implemented in an"
" Apple Event server. An Apple Event specifier is used as the direct object "
"for an Apple Event or as the argument of an optional parameter. The "
":mod:`aetypes` module contains the base classes for OSA classes and "
"properties, which are used by the packages generated by "
":mod:`gensuitemodule` to populate the classes and properties in a given "
"suite."

"For reasons of backward compatibility, and for cases where you need to "
