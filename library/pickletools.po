"This module contains various constants relating to the intimate details of "
"the :mod:`pickle` module, some lengthy comments about the implementation, "
"and a few useful functions for analyzing pickled data.  The contents of this "
"module are useful for Python core developers who are working on the :mod:"
"`pickle` and :mod:`cPickle` implementations; ordinary users of the :mod:"
"`pickle` module probably won't find the :mod:`pickletools` module relevant."

"Outputs a symbolic disassembly of the pickle to the file-like object *out*, "
"defaulting to ``sys.stdout``.  *pickle* can be a string or a file-like "
"object. *memo* can be a Python dictionary that will be used as the pickle's "
"memo; it can be used to perform disassemblies across multiple pickles "
"created by the same pickler. Successive levels, indicated by ``MARK`` "
"opcodes in the stream, are indented by *indentlevel* spaces."

msgid ""
"Provides an :term:`iterator` over all of the opcodes in a pickle, returning "
"a sequence of ``(opcode, arg, pos)`` triples.  *opcode* is an instance of "
"an :class:`OpcodeInfo` class; *arg* is the decoded value, as a Python "
"object, of the opcode's argument; *pos* is the position at which this opcode "
"is located. *pickle* can be a string or a file-like object."

"Returns a new equivalent pickle string after eliminating unused ``PUT`` "
"opcodes. The optimized pickle is shorter, takes less transmission time, "
"requires less storage space, and unpickles more efficiently."
