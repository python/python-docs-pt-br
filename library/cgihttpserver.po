msgid ":mod:`CGIHTTPServer` --- CGI-capable HTTP request handler"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:10
msgid ""
"The :mod:`CGIHTTPServer` module has been merged into :mod:`http.server` in "
"Python 3.  The :term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports when "
"converting your sources to Python 3."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:15
msgid ""
"The :mod:`CGIHTTPServer` module defines a request-handler class, interface "
"compatible with :class:`BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler` and inherits "
"behavior from :class:`SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` but can "
"also run CGI scripts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:22
msgid "This module can run CGI scripts on Unix and Windows systems."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:26
msgid ""
"CGI scripts run by the :class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` class cannot execute "
"redirects (HTTP code 302), because code 200 (script output follows) is sent "
"prior to execution of the CGI script.  This pre-empts the status code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:30
msgid "The :mod:`CGIHTTPServer` module defines the following class:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:35
msgid ""
"This class is used to serve either files or output of CGI scripts from  the "
"current directory and below. Note that mapping HTTP hierarchic structure to "
"local directory structure is exactly as in :class:`SimpleHTTPServer."
"SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:40
msgid ""
"The class will however, run the CGI script, instead of serving it as a file, "
"if it guesses it to be a CGI script. Only directory-based CGI are used --- "
"the other common server configuration is to treat special extensions as "
"denoting CGI scripts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:45
msgid ""
"The :func:`do_GET` and :func:`do_HEAD` functions are modified to run CGI "
"scripts and serve the output, instead of serving files, if the request leads "
"to somewhere below the ``cgi_directories`` path."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:49
msgid "The :class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` defines the following data member:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:54
msgid ""
"This defaults to ``['/cgi-bin', '/htbin']`` and describes directories to "
"treat as containing CGI scripts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:57
msgid "The :class:`CGIHTTPRequestHandler` defines the following methods:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:62
msgid ""
"This method serves the ``'POST'`` request type, only allowed for CGI "
"scripts.  Error 501, \"Can only POST to CGI scripts\", is output when trying "
"to POST to a non-CGI url."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/cgihttpserver.rst:66
msgid ""
"Note that CGI scripts will be run with UID of user nobody, for security "
"reasons. Problems with the CGI script will be translated to error 403."
