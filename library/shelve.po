"A \"shelf\" is a persistent, dictionary-like object.  The difference with "
"\"dbm\" databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be "
"essentially arbitrary Python objects --- anything that the :mod:`pickle` "
"module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types, "
"and objects containing lots of shared  sub-objects.  The keys are ordinary "
"strings."

"Because of Python semantics, a shelf cannot know when a mutable persistent-"

"*only* when assigned to the shelf (see :ref:`shelve-example`).  If the "
"optional *writeback* parameter is set to ``True``, all entries accessed are "
"also cached in memory, and written back on :meth:`~Shelf.sync` and :meth:"
"`~Shelf.close`; this can make it handier to mutate mutable entries in the "
"persistent dictionary, but, if many entries are accessed, it can consume "
"vast amounts of memory for the cache, and it can make the close operation "

"The choice of which database package will be used (such as :mod:`dbm.ndbm` "

"not safe to open the database directly using :mod:`dbm`.  The database is "
"also (unfortunately) subject to the limitations of :mod:`dbm`, if it is used "
"--- this means that (the pickled representation of) the objects stored in "
