"A \"shelf\" is a persistent, dictionary-like object.  The difference with "
"\"dbm\" databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be "
"essentially arbitrary Python objects --- anything that the :mod:`pickle` "
"module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types, "
"and objects containing lots of shared  sub-objects.  The keys are ordinary "
"strings."

"Open a persistent dictionary.  The filename specified is the base filename "
"for the underlying database.  As a side-effect, an extension may be added to "
"the filename and more than one file may be created.  By default, the "

"*flag* parameter has the same interpretation as the *flag* parameter of :"
"func:`anydbm.open`."

"Because of Python semantics, a shelf cannot know when a mutable persistent-"
"dictionary entry is modified.  By default modified objects are written "
"*only* when assigned to the shelf (see :ref:`shelve-example`).  If the "
"optional *writeback* parameter is set to ``True``, all entries accessed are "
"also cached in memory, and written back on :meth:`~Shelf.sync` and :meth:"
"`~Shelf.close`; this can make it handier to mutate mutable entries in the "
"persistent dictionary, but, if many entries are accessed, it can consume "
"vast amounts of memory for the cache, and it can make the close operation "
"very slow since all accessed entries are written back (there is no way to "
"determine which accessed entries are mutable, nor which ones were actually "
"mutated)."

"The choice of which database package will be used (such as :mod:`dbm`, :mod:"
"`gdbm` or :mod:`bsddb`) depends on which interface is available.  Therefore "
"it is not safe to open the database directly using :mod:`dbm`.  The database "
"is also (unfortunately) subject to the limitations of :mod:`dbm`, if it is "
"used --- this means that (the pickled representation of) the objects stored "
"in the database should be fairly small, and in rare cases key collisions may "
"cause the database to refuse updates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/shelve.rst:101
msgid ""
"The :mod:`shelve` module does not support *concurrent* read/write access to "
"shelved objects.  (Multiple simultaneous read accesses are safe.)  When a "
"program has a shelf open for writing, no other program should have it open "
"for reading or writing.  Unix file locking can be used to solve this, but "
"this differs across Unix versions and requires knowledge about the database "
"implementation used."
