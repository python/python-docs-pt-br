"This function is a :term:`decorator` that can be used to define a factory "
"function for :keyword:`with` statement context managers, without needing to "
"create a class or separate :meth:`__enter__` and :meth:`__exit__` methods."

"The function being decorated must return a :term:`generator`-iterator when "
"called. This iterator must yield exactly one value, which will be bound to "
"the targets in the :keyword:`with` statement's :keyword:`as` clause, if any."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/contextlib.rst:54
msgid ""
"At the point where the generator yields, the block nested in the :keyword:"
"`with` statement is executed.  The generator is then resumed after the block "
"is exited. If an unhandled exception occurs in the block, it is reraised "
"inside the generator at the point where the yield occurred.  Thus, you can "
"use a :keyword:`try`...\\ :keyword:`except`...\\ :keyword:`finally` "
"statement to trap the error (if any), or ensure that some cleanup takes "
"place. If an exception is trapped merely in order to log it or to perform "
"some action (rather than to suppress it entirely), the generator must "
"reraise that exception. Otherwise the generator context manager will "
"indicate to the :keyword:`with` statement that the exception has been "
"handled, and execution will resume with the statement immediately following "
"the :keyword:`with` statement."

msgstr ""

#: ../../library/contextlib.rst:74
msgid ""
"The one advantage of this function over the multiple manager form of the :"
"keyword:`with` statement is that argument unpacking allows it to be used "
"with a variable number of context managers as follows::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/contextlib.rst:83
msgid ""
"Note that if the :meth:`__exit__` method of one of the nested context "
"managers indicates an exception should be suppressed, no exception "
"information will be passed to any remaining outer context managers. "
"Similarly, if the :meth:`__exit__` method of one of the nested managers "
"raises an exception, any previous exception state will be lost; the new "
"exception will be passed to the :meth:`__exit__` methods of any remaining "
"outer context managers. In general, :meth:`__exit__` methods should avoid "
"raising exceptions, and in particular they should not re-raise a passed-in "
"exception."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/contextlib.rst:92
msgid ""
"This function has two major quirks that have led to it being deprecated. "
"Firstly, as the context managers are all constructed before the function is "
"invoked, the :meth:`__new__` and :meth:`__init__` methods of the inner "
"context managers are not actually covered by the scope of the outer context "
"managers. That means, for example, that using :func:`nested` to open two "
"files is a programming error as the first file will not be closed promptly "
"if an exception is thrown when opening the second file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/contextlib.rst:100
msgid ""
"Secondly, if the :meth:`__enter__` method of one of the inner context "
"managers raises an exception that is caught and suppressed by the :meth:"
"`__exit__` method of one of the outer context managers, this construct will "
"raise :exc:`RuntimeError` rather than skipping the body of the :keyword:"
"`with` statement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/contextlib.rst:106
msgid ""
"Developers that need to support nesting of a variable number of context "
"managers can either use the :mod:`warnings` module to suppress the "
"DeprecationWarning raised by this function or else use this function as a "
"model for an application specific implementation."
