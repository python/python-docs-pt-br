"The :mod:`linecache` module allows one to get any line from a Python source "
"file, while attempting to optimize internally, using a cache, the common "
"case where many lines are read from a single file.  This is used by the :mod:"
"`traceback` module to retrieve source lines for inclusion in  the formatted "
"traceback."

"The :func:`tokenize.open` function is used to open files. This function "
"uses :func:`tokenize.detect_encoding` to get the encoding of the file; in "
"the absence of an encoding token, the file encoding defaults to UTF-8."

"Get line *lineno* from file named *filename*. This function will never raise "
"an exception --- it will return ``''`` on errors (the terminating newline "
"character will be included for lines that are found)."

"If *filename* indicates a frozen module (starting with ``'<frozen '``), the "
"function will attepmt to get the real file name from "
"``module_globals['__file__']`` if *module_globals* is not ``None``."

#: ../../library/linecache.rst:37

"If a file named *filename* is not found, the function first checks for a :"
"pep:`302` ``__loader__`` in *module_globals*. If there is such a loader and "
"it defines a ``get_source`` method, then that determines the source lines "
"(if ``get_source()`` returns ``None``, then ``''`` is returned). Finally, if "
"*filename* is a relative filename, it is looked up relative to the entries "
"in the module search path, ``sys.path``."

"Capture enough detail about a non-file-based module to permit getting its "
"lines later via :func:`getline` even if *module_globals* is ``None`` in the "
