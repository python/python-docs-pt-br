"Return a new hmac object.  If *msg* is present, the method call "

"Return the digest of the strings passed to the :meth:`update` method so far. "

"When comparing the output of :meth:`digest` to an externally-supplied digest "

"Like :meth:`digest` except the digest is returned as a string twice the "
