"The :mod:`ttk` module provides access to the Tk themed widget set, which has "
"been introduced in Tk 8.5. If Python is not compiled against Tk 8.5 code may "
"still use this module as long as Tile is installed. However, some features "
"provided by the new Tk, like anti-aliased font rendering under X11, window "
"transparency (on X11 you will need a composition window manager) will be "
"missing."
