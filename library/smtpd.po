"Create a new :class:`SMTPServer` object, which binds to local address "
"*localaddr*.  It will treat *remoteaddr* as an upstream SMTP relayer.  Both "
"*localaddr* and *remoteaddr* should be a :ref:`(host, port) <host_port>` "

"constructor as *remoteaddr* will be available as the :attr:`_remoteaddr` "
"attribute. *peer* is the remote host's address, *mailfrom* is the envelope "
"originator, *rcpttos* are the envelope recipients and *data* is a string "
"containing the contents of the e-mail (which should be in :rfc:`2822` "
