"This module provides a class, :class:`SharedMemory`, for the allocation and "
"management of shared memory to be accessed by one or more processes on a "
"multicore or symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) machine.  To assist with the "
"life-cycle management of shared memory especially across distinct processes, "
"a :class:`~multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager` subclass, :class:"

"In this module, shared memory refers to \"POSIX style\" shared memory blocks "
"(though is not necessarily implemented explicitly as such) and does not "
"refer to \"distributed shared memory\".  This style of shared memory permits "
"distinct processes to potentially read and write to a common (or shared) "
"region of volatile memory.  Processes are conventionally limited to only "
"have access to their own process memory space but shared memory permits the "
"sharing of data between processes, avoiding the need to instead send "
"messages between processes containing that data.  Sharing data directly via "
"memory can provide significant performance benefits compared to sharing data "
"via disk or socket or other communications requiring the serialization/"
"deserialization and copying of data."

"When ``True``, register the shared memory block with a resource tracker "

"other processes with access to the memory exit without doing so. Python "
"processes created from a common ancestor using :mod:`multiprocessing` "
"facilities share a single resource tracker process, and the lifetime of "
"shared memory segments is handled automatically among these processes. "
"Python processes created in any other way will receive their own resource "
"tracker when accessing shared memory with *track* enabled. This will cause "
"the shared memory to be deleted by the resource tracker of the first process "
"that terminates. To avoid this issue, users of :mod:`subprocess` or "
"standalone Python processes should set *track* to ``False`` when there is "
"already another process in place that does the bookkeeping. *track* is "
