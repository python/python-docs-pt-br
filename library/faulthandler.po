"This module contains functions to dump Python tracebacks explicitly, on a "
"fault, after a timeout, or on a user signal. Call :func:`faulthandler."
"enable` to install fault handlers for the :const:`~signal.SIGSEGV`, :const:"
"`~signal.SIGFPE`, :const:`~signal.SIGABRT`, :const:`~signal.SIGBUS`, and :"
"const:`~signal.SIGILL` signals. You can also enable them at startup by "

"The fault handler is compatible with system fault handlers like Apport or "
