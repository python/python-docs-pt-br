"When creating :class:`~email.message.Message` objects from scratch, you "
"often need to encode the payloads for transport through compliant mail "
"servers. This is especially true for :mimetype:`image/\\*` and :mimetype:"
"`text/\\*` type messages containing binary data."

"The :mod:`email` package provides some convenient encodings in its :mod:"
"`encoders` module.  These encoders are actually used by the :class:`~email."
"mime.audio.MIMEAudio` and :class:`~email.mime.image.MIMEImage` class "
"constructors to provide default encodings.  All encoder functions take "
"exactly one argument, the message object to encode.  They usually extract "
"the payload, encode it, and reset the payload to this newly encoded value.  "
"They should also set the :mailheader:`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header as "
"appropriate."

"Note that these functions are not meaningful for a multipart message.  They "
"must be applied to individual subparts instead, and will raise a :exc:"
"`TypeError` if passed a message whose type is multipart."

"Encodes the payload into quoted-printable form and sets the :mailheader:"
"`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header to ``quoted-printable`` [#]_. This is a "
"good encoding to use when most of your payload is normal printable data, but "
"contains a few unprintable characters."

"Encodes the payload into base64 form and sets the :mailheader:`Content-"
"Transfer-Encoding` header to ``base64``.  This is a good encoding to use "
"when most of your payload is unprintable data since it is a more compact "
"form than quoted-printable.  The drawback of base64 encoding is that it "
"renders the text non-human readable."
