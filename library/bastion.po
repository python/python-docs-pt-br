"According to the dictionary, a bastion is \"a fortified area or position\", "
"or \"something that is considered a stronghold.\"  It's a suitable name for "
"this module, which provides a way to forbid access to certain attributes of "
"an object.  It must always be used with the :mod:`rexec` module, in order to "
"allow restricted-mode programs access to certain safe attributes of an "
"object, while denying access to other, unsafe attributes."

"Protect the object *object*, returning a bastion for the object.  Any "
"attempt to access one of the object's attributes will have to be approved by "
"the *filter* function; if the access is denied an :exc:`AttributeError` "
"exception will be raised."

"If present, *filter* must be a function that accepts a string containing an "
"attribute name, and returns true if access to that attribute will be "
"permitted; if *filter* returns false, the access is denied.  The default "
"filter denies access to any function beginning with an underscore "
"(``'_'``).  The bastion's string representation will be ``<Bastion for "
"name>`` if a value for *name* is provided; otherwise, ``repr(object)`` will "
"be used."

"Class which actually implements bastion objects.  This is the default class "

"execution environment when called with the name of the attribute as the only "
"parameter. *name* is used to construct the :func:`repr` of the :class:"
"`BastionClass` instance."
