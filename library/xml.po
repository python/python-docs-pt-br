"The `Billion Laughs`_ attack -- also known as exponential entity expansion "
"-- uses multiple levels of nested entities. Each entity refers to another "
"entity several times, and the final entity definition contains a small "

"A quadratic blowup attack is similar to a `Billion Laughs`_ attack; it "
"abuses entity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities it repeats one "
"large entity with a couple of thousand chars over and over again. The attack "
"isn't as efficient as the exponential case but it avoids triggering parser "
"countermeasures that forbid deeply nested entities."
