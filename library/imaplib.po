"Creating flags containing ']' (for example: \"[test]\") violates :rfc:`3501` "
"(the IMAP protocol).  However, imaplib has historically allowed creation of "
"such tags, and popular IMAP servers, such as Gmail, accept and produce such "
"flags.  There are non-Python programs which also create such tags.  Although "
"it is an RFC violation and IMAP clients and servers are supposed to be "
"strict, imaplib still continues to allow such tags to be created for "
"backward compatibility reasons, and as of Python 3.6, handles them if they "
"are sent from the server, since this improves real-world compatibility."
