"The :mod:`pprint` module provides a capability to \"pretty-print\" arbitrary"
" Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the "
"interpreter. If the formatted structures include objects which are not "
"fundamental Python types, the representation may not be loadable.  This may "
"be the case if objects such as files, sockets, classes, or instances are "
"included, as well as many other built-in objects which are not representable"
" as Python constants."

"Construct a :class:`PrettyPrinter` instance.  This constructor understands "
"several keyword parameters.  An output stream may be set using the *stream* "
"keyword; the only method used on the stream object is the file protocol's "
":meth:`write` method.  If not specified, the :class:`PrettyPrinter` adopts "
"``sys.stdout``.  Three additional parameters may be used to control the "
"formatted representation.  The keywords are *indent*, *depth*, and *width*."
"  The amount of indentation added for each recursive level is specified by "
"*indent*; the default is one.  Other values can cause output to look a "
"little odd, but can make nesting easier to spot.  The number of levels which"
" may be printed is controlled by *depth*; if the data structure being "
"printed is too deep, the next contained level is replaced by ``...``.  By "
"default, there is no constraint on the depth of the objects being formatted."
"  The desired output width is constrained using the *width* parameter; the "
"default is 80 characters.  If a structure cannot be formatted within the "
"constrained width, a best effort will be made."
