"This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in a "
"binary format.  The format is specific to Python, but independent of machine "
"architecture issues (e.g., you can write a Python value to a file on a PC, "
"transport the file to a Mac, and read it back there).  Details of the format "
"are undocumented on purpose; it may change between Python versions (although "
"it rarely does). [#]_"

"This is not a general \"persistence\" module.  For general persistence and "
"transfer of Python objects through RPC calls, see the modules :mod:`pickle` "
"and :mod:`shelve`.  The :mod:`marshal` module exists mainly to support "
"reading and writing the \"pseudo-compiled\" code for Python modules of :file:"
"`.pyc` files. Therefore, the Python maintainers reserve the right to modify "
"the marshal format in backward incompatible ways should the need arise. The "
"format of code objects is not compatible between Python versions, even if "
"the version of the format is the same. De-serializing a code object in the "
"incorrect Python version has undefined behavior. If you're serializing and "
"de-serializing Python objects, use the :mod:`pickle` module instead -- the "
"performance is comparable, version independence is guaranteed, and pickle "
"supports a substantially wider range of objects than marshal."
