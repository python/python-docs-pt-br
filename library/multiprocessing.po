":mod:`multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using "
"an API similar to the :mod:`threading` module.  The :mod:`multiprocessing` "
"package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping "
"the :term:`Global Interpreter Lock` by using subprocesses instead of "
"threads.  Due to this, the :mod:`multiprocessing` module allows the "
"programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine.  It "
"runs on both Unix and Windows."

"The :mod:`multiprocessing` module also introduces APIs which do not have "
"analogs in the :mod:`threading` module.  A prime example of this is the :"
"class:`Pool` object which offers a convenient means of parallelizing the "
"execution of a function across multiple input values, distributing the input "
"data across processes (data parallelism).  The following example "
"demonstrates the common practice of defining such functions in a module so "
"that child processes can successfully import that module.  This basic "
