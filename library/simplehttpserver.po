"The :mod:`SimpleHTTPServer` module has been merged into :mod:`http.server` "
"in Python 3.  The :term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports when "
"converting your sources to Python 3."

":mod:`SimpleHTTPServer` is not recommended for production. It only "
"implements basic security checks."

"The :mod:`SimpleHTTPServer` module defines a single class, "
":class:`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`, which is interface-compatible with "
":class:`BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler`."

"This class serves files from the current directory and below, directly "
"mapping the directory structure to HTTP requests."

#: ../../library/simplehttpserver.rst:31
msgid ""
"A lot of the work, such as parsing the request, is done by the base class "
":class:`BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler`.  This class implements the "
":func:`do_GET` and :func:`do_HEAD` functions."

"A dictionary mapping suffixes into MIME types. The default is signified by "

"The :class:`SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` class defines the following methods:"

#: ../../library/simplehttpserver.rst:57

"This method serves the ``'HEAD'`` request type: it sends the headers it "

"If the request was mapped to a directory, the directory is checked for a "
"file named ``index.html`` or ``index.htm`` (in that order). If found, the "
"file's contents are returned; otherwise a directory listing is generated by "
"calling the :meth:`list_directory` method. This method uses "

"response if the :func:`listdir` fails."

"If the request was mapped to a file, it is opened and the contents are "

"mapped to a ``404``, ``'File not found'`` error. Otherwise, the content type"
" is guessed by calling the :meth:`guess_type` method, which in turn uses the"
" *extensions_map* variable."
