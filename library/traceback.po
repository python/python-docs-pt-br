msgid ":mod:`traceback` --- Print or retrieve a stack traceback"
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/traceback.rst:8
msgid ""
"This module provides a standard interface to extract, format and print stack "
"traces of Python programs.  It exactly mimics the behavior of the Python "
"interpreter when it prints a stack trace.  This is useful when you want to "
"print stack traces under program control, such as in a \"wrapper\" around "
"the interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/traceback.rst:16
msgid ""
"The module uses traceback objects --- this is the object type that is stored "
"in the variables :data:`sys.exc_traceback` (deprecated) and :data:`sys."
"last_traceback` and returned as the third item from :func:`sys.exc_info`."

"Print up to *limit* stack trace entries from the traceback object *tb*. If "
"*limit* is omitted or ``None``, all entries are printed. If *file* is "
"omitted or ``None``, the output goes to ``sys.stderr``; otherwise it should "
"be an open file or file-like object to receive the output."

"Print exception information and up to *limit* stack trace entries from the "
"traceback *tb* to *file*. This differs from :func:`print_tb` in the "
"following ways: (1) if *tb* is not ``None``, it prints a header ``Traceback "
"(most recent call last):``; (2) it prints the exception *etype* and *value* "
"after the stack trace; (3) if *etype* is :exc:`SyntaxError` and *value* has "
"the appropriate format, it prints the line where the syntax error occurred "
"with a caret indicating the approximate position of the error."

"This is a shorthand for ``print_exception(sys.exc_type, sys.exc_value, sys."

"are extracted. A \"pre-processed\" stack trace entry is a 4-tuple "
"(*filename*, *line number*, function name*, *text*) representing the "
"information that is usually printed for a stack trace.  The *text* is a "
"string with leading and trailing whitespace stripped; if the source is not "
