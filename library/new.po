"The :mod:`new` module has been removed in Python 3.  Use the :mod:`types` "
"module's classes instead."

msgid ""
"The :mod:`new` module allows an interface to the interpreter object creation"
" functions. This is for use primarily in marshal-type functions, when a new "
"object needs to be created \"magically\" and not by using the regular "
"creation functions. This module provides a low-level interface to the "
"interpreter, so care must be exercised when using this module. It is "
"possible to supply non-sensical arguments which crash the interpreter when "
"the object is used."

msgid "The :mod:`new` module defines the following functions:"

msgid ""
"This function creates an instance of *class* with dictionary *dict* without "
"calling the :meth:`__init__` constructor.  If *dict* is omitted or ``None``,"
" a new, empty dictionary is created for the new instance.  Note that there "
"are no guarantees that the object will be in a consistent state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/new.rst:35
msgid ""
"This function will return a method object, bound to *instance*, or unbound "
"if *instance* is ``None``.  *function* must be callable."

#: ../../library/new.rst:41
msgid ""
"Returns a (Python) function with the given code and globals. If *name* is "
"given, it must be a string or ``None``.  If it is a string, the function "
"will have the given name, otherwise the function name will be taken from "
"``code.co_name``.  If *argdefs* is given, it must be a tuple and will be "
"used to determine the default values of parameters.  If *closure* is given, "
"it must be ``None`` or a tuple of cell objects containing objects to bind to"
" the names in ``code.co_freevars``."
