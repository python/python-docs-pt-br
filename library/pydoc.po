"The :mod:`!pydoc` module automatically generates documentation from Python "
"modules.  The documentation can be presented as pages of text on the "
"console, served to a web browser, or saved to HTML files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pydoc.rst:23
msgid ""
"For modules, classes, functions and methods, the displayed documentation is "
"derived from the docstring (i.e. the :attr:`~definition.__doc__` attribute) "
"of the object, and recursively of its documentable members.  If there is no "
"docstring, :mod:`!pydoc` tries to obtain a description from the block of "
"comment lines just above the definition of the class, function or method in "
"the source file, or at the top of the module (see :func:`inspect."
"getcomments`)."

"The built-in function :func:`help` invokes the online help system in the "
"interactive interpreter, which uses :mod:`!pydoc` to generate its "
"documentation as text on the console.  The same text documentation can also "
"be viewed from outside the Python interpreter by running :program:`pydoc` as "
"a script at the operating system's command prompt. For example, running ::"

"at a shell prompt will display documentation on the :mod:`sys` module, in a "
"style similar to the manual pages shown by the Unix :program:`man` command.  "
"The argument to :program:`pydoc` can be the name of a function, module, or "
"package, or a dotted reference to a class, method, or function within a "
"module or module in a package.  If the argument to :program:`pydoc` looks "
"like a path (that is, it contains the path separator for your operating "
"system, such as a slash in Unix), and refers to an existing Python source "
"file, then documentation is produced for that file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pydoc.rst:49
msgid ""
"In order to find objects and their documentation, :mod:`!pydoc` imports the "
"module(s) to be documented.  Therefore, any code on module level will be "
"executed on that occasion.  Use an ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` guard to "
"only execute code when a file is invoked as a script and not just imported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pydoc.rst:54
msgid ""
"When printing output to the console, :program:`pydoc` attempts to paginate "
"the output for easier reading.  If either the :envvar:`MANPAGER` or the :"
"envvar:`PAGER` environment variable is set, :program:`pydoc` will use its "
"value as a pagination program. When both are set, :envvar:`MANPAGER` is used."

"text on the console."

"Specifying a ``-k`` flag before the argument will search the synopsis lines "
"of all available modules for the keyword given as the argument, again in a "
"manner similar to the Unix :program:`man` command.  The synopsis line of a "
"module is the first line of its documentation string."

"You can also use :program:`pydoc` to start an HTTP server on the local "
"machine that will serve documentation to visiting web browsers.  :program:"
"`python -m pydoc -p 1234` will start a HTTP server on port 1234, allowing "
"you to browse the documentation at ``http://localhost:1234/`` in your "
"preferred web browser. Specifying ``0`` as the port number will select an "
"arbitrary unused port."

":program:`python -m pydoc -n <hostname>` will start the server listening at "
"the given hostname.  By default the hostname is 'localhost' but if you want "
"the server to be reached from other machines, you may want to change the "
"host name that the server responds to.  During development this is "
"especially useful if you want to run pydoc from within a container."
msgstr ""

#: ../../library/pydoc.rst:80
msgid ""
":program:`python -m pydoc -b` will start the server and additionally open a "
"web browser to a module index page.  Each served page has a navigation bar "
"at the top where you can *Get* help on an individual item, *Search* all "
"modules with a keyword in their synopsis line, and go to the *Module index*, "
"*Topics* and *Keywords* pages."

"When :program:`pydoc` generates documentation, it uses the current "
"environment and path to locate modules.  Thus, invoking :program:`pydoc "
"spam` documents precisely the version of the module you would get if you "
"started the Python interpreter and typed ``import spam``."
