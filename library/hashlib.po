"Randomized hashing is designed for situations where one party, the message "
"preparer, generates all or part of a message to be signed by a second party, "
"the message signer. If the message preparer is able to find cryptographic "
"hash function collisions (i.e., two messages producing the same hash value), "
"then they might prepare meaningful versions of the message that would "
"produce the same hash value and digital signature, but with different "
"results (e.g., transferring $1,000,000 to an account, rather than $10). "
"Cryptographic hash functions have been designed with collision resistance as "
"a major goal, but the current concentration on attacking cryptographic hash "
"functions may result in a given cryptographic hash function providing less "
"collision resistance than expected. Randomized hashing offers the signer "
"additional protection by reducing the likelihood that a preparer can "
"generate two or more messages that ultimately yield the same hash value "
"during the digital signature generation process --- even if it is practical "
"to find collisions for the hash function. However, the use of randomized "
"hashing may reduce the amount of security provided by a digital signature "
"when all portions of the message are prepared by the signer."
