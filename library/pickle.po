"The :mod:`pickle` module implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm "
"for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.  \"Pickling\" "
"is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte "
"stream, and \"unpickling\" is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream "
"is converted back into an object hierarchy.  Pickling (and unpickling) is "
"alternatively known as \"serialization\", \"marshalling,\" [#]_ or "
"\"flattening\", however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are "
"\"pickling\" and \"unpickling\"."

"The :mod:`pickle` module has an optimized cousin called the :mod:`cPickle` "

"subclassing of the :func:`Pickler` and :func:`Unpickler` classes, because "
"in :mod:`cPickle` these are functions, not classes.  Most applications have "
"no need for this functionality, and can benefit from the improved "
"performance of :mod:`cPickle`. Other than that, the interfaces of the two "

"This has implications both for recursive objects and object sharing.  "
"Recursive objects are objects that contain references to themselves.  These "
"are not handled by marshal, and in fact, attempting to marshal recursive "
"objects will crash your Python interpreter.  Object sharing happens when "
"there are multiple references to the same object in different places in the "

"once, and ensures that all other references point to the master copy.  "
"Shared objects remain shared, which can be very important for mutable "

"Isso tem implicações tanto para objetos recursivos quanto para "
"compartilhamento de objetos. Objetos recursivos são objetos que contêm "
"referências a si mesmos. Eles não são tratados pelo marshal e, de fato, "
"tentar usar marshal em objetos recursivos irá travar seu interpretador "
"Python. O compartilhamento de objetos ocorre quando há várias referências ao "
"mesmo objeto em locais diferentes na hierarquia de objetos sendo "
"serializados. :mod:`pickle` armazena tais objetos apenas uma vez, e garante "
"que todas as outras referências apontem para a cópia mestre. Os objetos "
"compartilhados permanecem compartilhados, o que pode ser muito importante "
"para objetos mutáveis."

":mod:`marshal` cannot be used to serialize user-defined classes and their "

"transform a complex object into a byte stream and it can transform the byte "
"stream into an object with the same internal structure.  Perhaps the most "
"obvious thing to do with these byte streams is to write them onto a file, "
"but it is also conceivable to send them across a network or store them in a "
