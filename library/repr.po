"The :mod:`repr` module has been renamed to :mod:`reprlib` in Python 3.  The :"
"term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your "
"sources to Python 3."

"The :mod:`repr` module provides a means for producing object representations "
"with limits on the size of the resulting strings. This is used in the Python "
"debugger and may be useful in other contexts as well."

#: ../../library/repr.rst:27

"Class which provides formatting services useful in implementing functions "
"similar to the built-in :ref:`repr() <func-repr>`; size limits for different "
"object types are added to avoid the generation of representations which are "
"excessively long."

#: ../../library/repr.rst:42

"This is the :meth:`~Repr.repr` method of ``aRepr``.  It returns a string "
