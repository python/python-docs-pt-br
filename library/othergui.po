"PyQt is a :program:`sip`\\ -wrapped binding to the Qt toolkit.  Qt is an "
"extensive C++ GUI application development framework that is available for "
"Unix, Windows and Mac OS X. :program:`sip` is a tool for generating bindings"
" for C++ libraries as Python classes, and is specifically designed for "
"Python. The *PyQt3* bindings have a book, `GUI Programming with Python: QT "
"Edition <https://www.commandprompt.com/community/pyqt/>`_ by Boudewijn "
"Rempt. The *PyQt4* bindings also have a book, `Rapid GUI Programming with "

"wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for Python that is built around the"
" popular `wxWidgets <https://www.wxwidgets.org/>`_ (formerly wxWindows) C++ "
"toolkit.  It provides a native look and feel for applications on Windows, "
"Mac OS X, and Unix systems by using each platform's native widgets where "
"ever possible, (GTK+ on Unix-like systems).  In addition to an extensive set"
" of widgets, wxPython provides classes for online documentation and context "
"sensitive help, printing, HTML viewing, low-level device context drawing, "
"drag and drop, system clipboard access, an XML-based resource format and "
"more, including an ever growing library of user-contributed modules.  "
"wxPython has a book, `wxPython in Action "
"<https://www.manning.com/books/wxpython-in-action>`_, by Noel Rappin and "
"Robin Dunn."

"PyGTK, PyQt, and wxPython, all have a modern look and feel and more widgets "
"than Tkinter. In addition, there are many other GUI toolkits for Python, "
"both cross-platform, and platform-specific. See the `GUI Programming "
"<https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming>`_ page in the Python Wiki for "
"a much more complete list, and also for links to documents where the "
"different GUI toolkits are compared."
