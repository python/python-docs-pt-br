"This module allows you to access the Sun audio interface. The Sun audio "

"This function opens the audio device and returns a Sun audio device object. "
"This object can then be used to do I/O on. The *mode* parameter is one of "
"``'r'`` for record-only access, ``'w'`` for play-only access, ``'rw'`` for "
"both and ``'control'`` for access to the control device. Since only one "
"process is allowed to have the recorder or player open at the same time it "
"is a good idea to open the device only for the activity needed. See :manpage:"
"`audio(7I)` for details."

"As per the manpage, this module first looks in the environment variable "
"``AUDIODEV`` for the base audio device filename.  If not found, it falls "

"This method retrieves status information like input and output volume, etc. "

"methods but it contains a number of attributes describing the current device "
"status. The names and meanings of the attributes are described in ``<sun/"
"audioio.h>`` and in the :manpage:`audio(7I)` manual page.  Member names are "
"slightly different from their C counterparts: a status object is only a "
"single structure. Members of the :c:data:`play` substructure have ``o_`` "
"prepended to their name and members of the :c:data:`record` structure have "
"``i_``. So, the C member :c:data:`play.sample_rate` is accessed as :attr:"
"`o_sample_rate`, :c:data:`record.gain` as :attr:`i_gain` and :c:data:"
