"The setup script is the centre of all activity in building, distributing, "

"various commands that operate on your modules do the right thing.  As we saw "
"in section :ref:`distutils-simple-example` above, the setup script consists "

"simple error message before the script is terminated.  The motivation for "
"this behaviour is to not confuse administrators who don't know much about "
"Python and are trying to install a package.  If they get a big long "
"traceback from deep inside the guts of Distutils, they may think the package "
"or the Python installation is broken because they don't read all the way "
