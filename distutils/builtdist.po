"A \"built distribution\" is what you're probably used to thinking of either "
"as a \"binary package\" or an \"installer\" (depending on your background).  "
"It's not necessarily binary, though, because it might contain only Python "
"source code and/or byte-code; and we don't call it a package, because that "
"word is already spoken for in Python.  (And \"installer\" is a term specific "
"to the world of mainstream desktop systems.)"

"A built distribution is how you make life as easy as possible for installers "
"of your module distribution: for users of RPM-based Linux systems, it's a "

"based Linux users, it's a Debian package; and so forth.  Obviously, no one "
"person will be able to create built distributions for every platform under "
"the sun, so the Distutils are designed to enable module developers to "
"concentrate on their specialty---writing code and creating source "
"distributions---while an intermediary species called *packagers* springs up "
