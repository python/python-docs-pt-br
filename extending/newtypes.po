"The Python runtime sees all Python objects as variables of type "
":c:type:`PyObject\\*`.  A :c:type:`PyObject` is not a very magnificent "
"object - it just contains the refcount and a pointer to the object's \"type "
"object\".  This is where the action is; the type object determines which (C)"
" functions get called when, for instance, an attribute gets looked up on an "
"object or it is multiplied by another object.  These C functions are called "
"\"type methods\"."

"For an object which represents an iterable collection, the ``tp_iter`` "
"handler must return an iterator object.  The iterator object is responsible "
"for maintaining the state of the iteration.  For collections which can "
"support multiple iterators which do not interfere with each other (as lists "
"and tuples do), a new iterator should be created and returned.  Objects "
"which can only be iterated over once (usually due to side effects of "
"iteration) should implement this handler by returning a new reference to "
"themselves, and should also implement the ``tp_iternext`` handler.  File "
"objects are an example of such an iterator."

"Iterator objects should implement both handlers.  The ``tp_iter`` handler "
"should return a new reference to the iterator (this is the same as the "
"``tp_iter`` handler for objects which can only be iterated over "
"destructively).  The ``tp_iternext`` handler should return a new reference "
"to the next object in the iteration if there is one.  If the iteration has "
"reached the end, it may return *NULL* without setting an exception or it may"
" set :exc:`StopIteration`; avoiding the exception can yield slightly better "
"performance.  If an actual error occurs, it should set an exception and "
"return *NULL*."
