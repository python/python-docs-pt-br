"Starting in Python 1.4, Python provides, on Unix, a special make file for "
"building make files for building dynamically-linked extensions and custom "
"interpreters.  Starting with Python 2.0, this mechanism (known as related to "
"Makefile.pre.in, and Setup files) is no longer supported. Building custom "
"interpreters was rarely used, and extension modules can be built using "
"distutils."

"Building an extension module using distutils requires that distutils is "
"installed on the build machine, which is included in Python 2.x and "
"available separately for Python 1.5. Since distutils also supports creation "
"of binary packages, users don't necessarily need a compiler and distutils to "
"install the extension."

"A distutils package contains a driver script, :file:`setup.py`. This is a "
"plain Python file, which, in the most simple case, could look like this:"

"like :file:`demo.so` or :file:`demo.pyd`."

"In the :file:`setup.py`, all execution is performed by calling the ``setup`` "
"function. This takes a variable number of keyword arguments, of which the "
"example above uses only a subset. Specifically, the example specifies meta-"
"information to build packages, and it specifies the contents of the "
"package.  Normally, a package will contain of addition modules, like Python "
"source modules, documentation, subpackages, etc. Please refer to the "
"distutils documentation in :ref:`distutils-index` to learn more about the "
"features of distutils; this section explains building extension modules only."

"It is common to pre-compute arguments to :func:`setup`, to better structure "
"the driver script. In the example above, the ``ext_modules`` argument to :"
"func:`setup` is a list of extension modules, each of which is an instance of "
"the :class:`~distutils.extension.Extension`. In the example, the instance "
"defines an extension named ``demo`` which is build by compiling a single "
"source file, :file:`demo.c`."

"In many cases, building an extension is more complex, since additional "

"In this example, :func:`setup` is called with additional meta-information, "
"which is recommended when distribution packages have to be built. For the "
"extension itself, it specifies preprocessor defines, include directories, "
"library directories, and libraries. Depending on the compiler, distutils "
"passes this information in different ways to the compiler. For example, on "
"Unix, this may result in the compilation commands ::"
